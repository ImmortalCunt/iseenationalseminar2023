The National Seminar on Evolving Extension Science Towards Secondary Agriculture for Sustainable Development,

The National Seminar on Evolving Extension Science Towards Secondary Agriculture for Sustainable Development is a platform for discussions and deliberations on the promotion of secondary agriculture. The seminar aims to identify appropriate strategies for the transition to secondary agriculture and highlight the achievements and challenges of implementing secondary agriculture practices. The seminar focuses on the role of extension education in facilitating farmer welfare and sustainable agricultural growth. The systematic approach and scientifically backed research and extension strategies for secondary agriculture are limited both at the national and state level, and the seminar aims to address this issue by bringing together experts from various fields to discuss and share their experiences and knowledge. The State of Karnataka has established the separate Directorate of Secondary Agriculture, making it an ideal location for the seminar. The seminar provides an opportunity to identify extension science for the transition to secondary agriculture and promote sustainable agriculture development in the farming community.
