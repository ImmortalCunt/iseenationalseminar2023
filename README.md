		<h1>Extension Education in Agriculture Development</h1>
		<p><span class="highlight">Extension education</span> plays an important role in <span class="highlight">agriculture development</span>. Extension has evolved from playing a primary role in disseminating agricultural technologies to a holistic discipline of facilitating farmer’s welfare and sustainable agricultural growth. Amidst the emerging dynamics of market and policy reforms by the Government, <span class="highlight">secondary agriculture</span> has the potential to offer solutions to challenges in agriculture. In this context, the extension discipline has a challenge to identify and suggest extension science for transition to secondary agriculture to attain sustainable development. In India, farmers are gainfully employed in the primary activity of farming only for about 180 days. Any activity on the farm that is done beyond the Kharif, Rabi and Summer seasons is the secondary agriculture. Cleaning, sorting and grading, processing, value addition along the supply chain of agri produce are considered as secondary agriculture. Secondary Agriculture can generate large number of jobs and enhance farmers’ income.</p>
    	<p>Though secondary agriculture has been practiced for many years, the systematic approach and scientifically backed research and extension strategies are limited both at the national and state level. The State of Karnataka has the credit of establishing the separate Directorate of Secondary Agriculture during 2021-22. Hence, there is need for deliberation on various aspects of secondary agriculture to evolve appropriate strategies for promotion of secondary agriculture. The national seminar attempts to provide a platform for deliberations on the achievements and a way forward to take principles and practices of secondary agriculture for the benefit of the farming community towards sustainable agriculture development.</p>
